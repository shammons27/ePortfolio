            <h1 id="insight3-title">Research as Psycholinguistics</h1>
            <div class="section1 text">
                <p>Embarking on my journey into the realm of psychology, I found myself increasingly drawn to the intricacies of psycholinguistics, a facet of cognitive psychology I learned about in <strong class="bold">PSYC300: Introduction to Language Science</strong>
                    . This fascinating field, with its focus on how we acquire, understand, produce, and represent language (including its neurological underpinnings), began to feel less like a discrete subject and more like a fundamental framework for navigating the world of research itself. <span class="custom-bold">It struck me that learning to be a good researcher echoed the very processes involved in mastering a language.</span> </p>
                <p>My initial forays into research in the <strong class="bold">Neurolinguistics Lab</strong> in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders in the Arnold School of Public Health, particularly as I began my Senior Thesis, a requirement of the South Carolina Honors College, felt akin to being immersed in a completely new linguistic environment. Suddenly, I was surrounded by unfamiliar concepts – literature reviews, the practicalities of phonetic software, diverse research methods, and the seemingly arcane rules of citation. Just as language <strong class="bold">acquisition</strong> demands exposure, practice, and a gradual ascent towards fluency, these early research experiences required dedicated immersion and persistent effort. I recall the initial confusion as I tried to grasp new theoretical frameworks and methodologies. It was during this time that Piaget’s concepts of assimilation and accommodation, a concept introduced to me in <strong class="bold">PSYC420: Survey of Developmental Psychology</strong>, truly resonated. Learning to conduct research in a psychology lab, particularly after my prior experiences in a neurolinguistics setting, demanded not just fitting new information into my existing understanding but also fundamentally altering my schemas and even creating entirely new ones to accommodate these novel research practices. </p>
                <p>As I progressed, the importance of <strong class="bold">comprehension</strong> in research became increasingly clear. It wasn't enough to simply read studies; I needed to truly understand and interpret the information they presented and analyze literature, data, and existing studies to grasp the current state of knowledge in my chosen area. This necessitated honing my critical reading skills – learning to critically evaluate the strength of evidence, appreciate different scholarly viewpoints, and identify the inevitable gaps in the existing body of research. I also had to develop the ability to extract relevant information, to sift through complex texts and pinpoint the key ideas, arguments, and data that would meaningfully inform my own research endeavors. Furthermore, understanding the methodology behind each study – comprehending how they were designed and conducted, acknowledging their inherent strengths and limitations – became crucial for determining the applicability of their findings to my own work. One particular experience stands out: while writing a research paper for my <strong class="bold">Danish Society and Culture</strong> course, which involved comparing patient satisfaction across different healthcare systems, I realized the transferability of these comprehension skills beyond my immediate field. Being able to engage with literature from diverse areas allowed me to meaningfully investigate the different sectors, funding mechanisms, and resulting outcomes, ultimately offering insights into the psychological impact of receiving healthcare in different formats. 
                </p>
                <p>The next stage in my research development involved <strong class="bold">production</strong>: the active creation of new knowledge. This encompassed the exciting, yet sometimes daunting, tasks of synthesizing information, developing my own hypotheses, and, ultimately, writing about my findings. This involved several key applications: the generation of novel research questions sparked by the very gaps I had identified in the literature; the intricate process of designing experiments, which required carefully developing appropriate methodologies to test those questions; and the crucial step of writing and communicating my research findings, which demanded not only a clear articulation of my results but also a robust justification of my chosen methods and a careful relating of my findings to the existing body of knowledge, not to mention the often-nerve-wracking experience of peer review. I vividly recall my time in <span class="custom-bold">SAEL200: Social Advocacy and Ethical Life</span>, where I learned the essential skill of effectively communicating an argument and defending it against the scrutiny of my peers and professor. Although public speaking initially presented a significant challenge, I developed a creative strategy involving meticulous notetaking and strategic preparation to ensure I fully understood the information and could present it eloquently. This experience underscored the vital role of effective production and communication in the research process. 
                </p>
                <p>Finally, I began to appreciate the significance of <strong class="bold">representation</strong>– how information is organized, stored, and retrieved in the brain. In the context of research, this involves the crucial ability to build connections between seemingly disparate ideas, to retain vast amounts of knowledge over time, and to structure complex findings in an effective and coherent manner. This ability is fundamental for making sense of the often overwhelming volumes of data, identifying underlying patterns, and ultimately constructing compelling and logical arguments. I learned that cognitive representation involves how research concepts become embedded in our own cognitive framework, with researchers actively building schemas that help categorize and connect new information as it emerges. I also discovered the immense value of external tools in managing the research process, such as the strategic use of annotated bibliographies, concept and mind maps, reference management software, and personal research journals or note-taking systems. Effective representation, I realized, is not just about writing and communication, ensuring a logically structured narrative, but also critically important for memory and retrieval in research, enabling me to readily recall relevant theories, methodologies, and crucial data when needed. Looking back, the parallels between learning a language and learning to conduct research are striking. Just as a linguist hones their skills in acquisition, comprehension, production, and representation, so too must a researcher cultivate these very abilities. By recognizing this inherent connection, and by consciously applying the principles of psycholinguistics to the research process, I have come to see a clearer pathway towards becoming a more proficient and effective contributor to my field.

                            <p>This class was research-based and was capped with a hypothetical project working with a linguist faculty member. This project had us design a research question and methodology to investigate a linguistic concept we learned about. My Senior Thesis explores the connection between speech production stability and cognition and motor control. I took this class in the fall semester of my junior year, so this PowerPoint represents the status of my project at that time. This class helped me understand basic linguistic concepts as I was reading complex texts about speech production and its connection to other neural networks. </p>

                        <p>This class required a final paper comparing one aspect of society or culture from Denmark and one from my home country. I chose to investigate patient satisfaction in healthcare because of the stark differences between Denmark’s and the US’s approach to healthcare. I analyzed the structure, funding, and applicability of Danish and American healthcare systems in the opposite country’s status population- and resource-wise. This was an extensive research project that I was prepared to undertake because of my previous experience conducting literature reviews and critically analyzing scholarly articles. This artifact is the hand-written outline showing the resources I used. </p></p>

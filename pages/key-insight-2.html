                <div class="section1 text">
                    <p> I came into college knowing I wanted to study psychology. However, I chose this major with the intention of pursuing a career in counseling and one day running my own practice. In 2022, USC began offering neuroscience as both a major and minor. Despite wanting to go into counseling, I chose to declare neuroscience as my minor as most credits for neuroscience and psych were interchangeable initially. Through this addition, though, I discovered neuroscience and research were more interesting to me and switched my career goals accordingly. I quickly became more enthralled by the neural structures and pathways than by the behavioral and mental effects I was originally interested in studying and treating. This discovery was crucial to my development as a researcher. <span class="custom-bold">Because of my engagement with neuroscience with my formal psychology background, I have had the opportunity to engage in meaningful research on a disorder that I am personally affected by, further solidifying my passion for pursuing research as a career.</span> </p>
                    <p>My first neuroscience course, <span class="custom-bold">PSYC455: Introduction to Neuroscience</span>, is to date one of the hardest courses I have ever taken. Not only did this class push me out of my comfort zone concept-wise, but the style of learning was also new to me. We had what I refer to as “exam weeks” where we deep dived into the textbook to deliver ten short-answer and five essays in the span of one week. These exams required fast integration of nervous system structures and pathways to explain how our brains function. Because of the demanding amount and timespan of studying needed for these exams, I gained efficient techniques for understanding and remembering brain structures. Not only did I perform well in the class, but I still use this skill to read academic literature for classes and lab projects fluently. In this way, my foundational knowledge of the structures of the brain continue to serve me both within the classroom and beyond.</p>
                    <p>The very next year, the opportunity to put my knowledge to the test came. I took <span class="custom-bold">PSYC405: Cognitive Psychology</span> and through this class was introduced to misophonia, a disorder characterized by a lowered tolerance for certain sounds. The <span class="custom-bold"> Affect and Cognition Lab</span> runs an fMRI study on misophonia. I instantly recognized myself as someone who has this disorder and aimed to get involved as quickly as possible. Knowing about different neuroimaging techniques from <span class="custom-bold">PSYC221: Research Methods in Psychology</span>, I quickly gathered the goal of the study was to determine the neural structures involved in misophonic reactions as fMRI picks up signals from oxygenated blood to show where increased blood flow, a marker of increased activity, is in the brain. The study not only piqued my interest in the disorder itself but also in how I could get involved in the lab beyond participation. </p>
                    <p>After taking a research methods course, I realized the best way to learn how to conduct ethical and effective research was to do so hands on. Joining the Affect and Cognition Lab allowed me to deep dive into the research process by training, working closely with professors and graduate students, and beginning personal projects. The misophonia study consists of many moving parts such as stimuli generation, physiology data collection, coding, and fMRI. Shortly after joining the lab, my interest was quickly drawn to data collection. I was trained to collect heart rate, galvanic skin response, skin temperature, and facial movement data. I even modeled the set up for conference presentations! I also have witnessed and been in several fMRI scans. Seeing the backstage happenings of psychology research first-hand, tied with my interest in reading the reference publications the study is inspired by, was vital in my understanding of the importance of research on the disorder. </p>
                    <p>The working theory of the neural structures involved in misophonia include structures responsible for sound and emotion processing. The anterior insular cortex (AIC) manages interoception, or our awareness of internal body states, and emotion processing. fMRI studies have shown hyperconnectivity between the AIC and the superior temporal gyrus (STG), part of our higher-order auditory cortex that processes speech, music, and emotional aspects of sounds. These findings demonstrate how misophonic trigger sounds may be processed as personally significant and cause feelings of anger, panic, and disgust. Being able to tie research findings on the disorder to the behavioral outputs of misophonia in myself and others is due to my understanding of neural structures and their functions in addition to my knowledge of psychology and the individualistic differences even those with the same diagnosis can have. </p>
                    <p>My everyday life is affected by my misophonia. There are certain rules we have in my apartment and house that family and friends thankfully are happy to abide by. These include the use of plastic plates over ceramic ones, no whistling, and the necessity of background noise if people are eating. The sense of relief and understanding I felt when I heard my weird requests have a name was overwhelming. As I continue to push towards a career in research, I am reminded of the importance of passion and interest in topics as these topics are not just concepts, they are people’s lives. Misophonia, while unpleasant and uncomfortable, has opened the door for my engagement with neuroimaging and research techniques, learning through experience, and spreading awareness through research about the disorder. I would say, without a doubt, I have turned something bad into something good.</p>

                 <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Illiteracy remains a significant challenge in South Carolina, with approximately 22.4% of adults reading below a third grade level (2025), affecting nearly 800,000 individuals statewide. According to WACH Fox 57, across the State, around 25 percent of students scored below average on the South Carolina Ready read and writing exam (2023). Specifically in Richland School District One, 35% of students scored below average (Jordon, 2023). This issue begins early, as many children face obstacles in developing strong literacy skills, which can hinder academic success and future opportunities. Recognizing the urgency of this problem, the Richland County School System must implement interactive and feasible literacy interventions that engage students in meaningful ways. A structured book club—where students read high-interest fiction, discuss themes, and develop comprehension skills in a supportive environment—offers a practical and engaging solution. By integrating collaborative discussions, creative projects, and real-world connections, this approach fosters a love for reading while improving literacy outcomes.

                    <p>
                        The success of the Literacy Intervention Book Club relies on a collaborative effort among ELA teachers, trained volunteers, and parents who play key roles in fostering student engagement. ELA teachers will lead the program, not only facilitating book club sessions but also developing training materials to ensure consistency in instruction. They will provide professional development for volunteers and parents, equipping them with effective strategies for guiding discussions, supporting comprehension, and encouraging critical thinking. Volunteers, including community members and older student mentors, will assist in small group discussions, making the experience more interactive and personalized. Additionally, parents will have the opportunity to participate in book club activities, reinforcing reading habits at home and strengthening family involvement in literacy development. This multi-faceted approach ensures that students receive continuous support from both educators and their broader community, creating a more inclusive and sustainable intervention.

                    <h4 id="solution-subtitle">WHEN?</h4>
                   <p>
                        The Literacy Intervention Book Club would take place during a designated period within the school day, ideally replacing or enhancing existing independent reading time in ELA classes. Teachers could integrate book club activities into the curriculum by using this time to not only read fiction but also to strengthen vocabulary, improve writing skills, and enhance critical thinking through guided discussions and literary analysis. Alternatively, schools could schedule book club sessions during an elective period, study hall, or after-school enrichment program to provide additional flexibility. Each book club cycle would last 6-8 weeks, allowing students to deeply engage with a novel while developing key literacy skills. While all middle school students could benefit, the program would primarily target 6th to 8th graders who struggle with reading comprehension or need extra support to build confidence and fluency. By embedding book club into the existing structure of ELA instruction, teachers can ensure that it complements rather than disrupts their curriculum while maximizing student participation.

                    <h4 id="solution-subtitle">WHAT?</h4>
                   <p>
                        The Literacy Intervention Book Club would center around age-appropriate and engaging fiction novels that captivate students’ interests while reinforcing literacy skills. Books would be carefully selected to include diverse perspectives, relatable themes, and varying reading levels, ensuring accessibility for all students. Library staff would play a key role by helping students discover books that match their interests, promoting independent reading habits beyond the classroom, and introducing them to library resources for further exploration. To keep students actively engaged, the book club would incorporate a variety of interactive activities such as small-group discussions, creative writing prompts, dramatic reenactments, artistic projects, and multimedia responses that allow students to express comprehension in different ways. To measure progress, evaluation tools would include student reading journals, informal teacher observations, peer feedback, and comprehension quizzes, all of which account for different learning styles and paces. This approach ensures that book club sessions are dynamic, inclusive, and adaptable, making literacy improvement both effective and enjoyable for every student.

                    <h4 id="solution-subtitle">WHY?</h4>
                   <p>
                        Improving literacy, particularly through fiction novels, is crucial for middle school students because it not only enhances reading comprehension but also develops a range of cognitive, emotional, and social skills that are essential for lifelong success. At this age, students are at a pivotal stage in their academic and personal development, where their ability to read and understand texts directly impacts their overall academic performance. Fiction novels, in particular, help students expand their vocabulary, understand complex sentence structures, and improve critical thinking by analyzing plot developments, character motivations, and thematic elements. Moreover, reading fiction encourages empathy, as students are exposed to diverse characters, experiences, and worldviews, fostering a deeper understanding of others' perspectives. By focusing on middle school students, we target a critical period where reading habits are forming, and students are transitioning from learning to read to reading to learn. A solid foundation in fiction not only improves academic performance in ELA but also strengthens writing, analysis, and communication skills in all subjects. Additionally, fiction novels allow students to explore complex themes like identity, conflict, and social issues, providing valuable lessons about the world around them. This investment in literacy development not only supports immediate academic growth but also helps shape well-rounded, empathetic individuals who are prepared to succeed in high school, higher education, and beyond.

                    <h4 id="solution-subtitle">HOW?</h4>
                   <p>
                        To pilot the Literacy Intervention Book Club, we would start by selecting a couple of middle school classes across grades 6-8, focusing on students identified as needing additional support in literacy. Throughout the pilot, we would use a combination of evaluation tools—including reading journals, comprehension quizzes, teacher observations, and peer feedback—to assess student engagement and progress. By tracking individual student growth, we would measure improvements in reading comprehension, vocabulary development, and critical thinking skills, while also taking into account each student’s learning style. After the pilot, we would analyze the data to identify which age groups (grades 6-8) benefitted the most in terms of literacy gains, engagement levels, and overall participation. This analysis would help determine which aspects of the program were most effective for each grade level, providing insights into how the book club could be adapted for different age groups or further implemented into other school systems. For example, if certain activities or book choices resonated particularly well with one grade, those could be incorporated into future iterations. We would also gather feedback from teachers, parents, and volunteers to refine the program and ensure it is scalable and adaptable to other districts, potentially expanding to include additional schools or grade levels. By documenting the successes and challenges of the pilot program, we would be able to create a comprehensive implementation plan that can be tailored for broader adoption, making it a sustainable and impactful literacy intervention model across various educational settings.

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    The Literacy Intervention Book Club may face several challenges in its implementation. First, time constraints could make scheduling book club sessions difficult, especially with tight curricula and limited instructional periods. Teachers might struggle to balance these additional activities with core subjects like math, science, and social studies, and fitting the book club into an already packed schedule could be a significant obstacle. Another challenge is the diverse reading levels among middle school students. With varying abilities, selecting books that are accessible yet engaging for all students can be tricky, as some may struggle with comprehension, leading to frustration and disengagement. Additionally, maintaining student interest can be difficult, as not all middle school students may be excited about reading fiction, especially if the selected books don't resonate with their personal interests. Resource limitations also pose a challenge, particularly in providing enough books for every student. Schools with limited budgets may struggle to ensure there are enough copies, and relying on school libraries and community donations may not always meet demand. The success of the program also depends heavily on parental and volunteer support, but busy schedules and a lack of training could limit their involvement. Without proper orientation and clear expectations, volunteers and parents may not provide the necessary engagement for the program to thrive. Furthermore, teacher buy-in and training could be an obstacle, as ELA teachers may be concerned about taking on extra responsibilities like training volunteers while managing their existing workload. Another challenge lies in the varied learning styles of students, as some may struggle with traditional reading and discussion-based approaches. Adapting the program to accommodate students with different learning preferences, such as visual, kinesthetic, or auditory needs, could be difficult without disrupting the core focus of the book club. Consistency and attendance may also be an issue, particularly if the book club is held outside of regular school hours or during non-mandatory periods, which could affect group cohesion and leave some students behind. Lastly, measuring the success of the program presents a challenge, as standardized testing may not fully capture the nuances of literary comprehension and personal growth. Identifying meaningful and individualized assessment tools is key but can be difficult without making students feel judged or discouraged. Despite these obstacles, addressing these challenges through flexibility and collaboration among educators, parents, volunteers, and students can help ensure the book club's success.

                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, the Literacy Intervention Book Club has the potential to evolve and expand to further support literacy development across middle schools. One key direction is the incorporation of technology, such as digital platforms or apps, to enhance student engagement and accessibility, allowing for virtual book club sessions, interactive discussions, and access to e-books and audiobooks. Additionally, the program could be expanded to include cross-curricular integration, where students connect themes from the books to other subjects like history, science, or social studies, deepening their understanding of both content and context. Data-driven assessments could also be implemented to better track individual progress and adjust activities based on student needs, providing a more tailored approach to literacy development. Further, collaboration with local authors, literacy advocates, and community organizations could bring in outside perspectives, offering students unique opportunities to connect with the wider literary world. Finally, increasing parent and community involvement through workshops and events would help create a more holistic support system, reinforcing literacy skills at home and within the community. These future directions could strengthen the book club’s impact, ensuring it remains a sustainable and dynamic tool for improving literacy among middle school students.

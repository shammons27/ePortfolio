            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                During my time at USC, I have had many opportunities to get involved in leadership,
                research, and community that has shaped my undergraduate experience into a well-rounded and
                critical period of my academic development. Currently, I serve as a University 201 Peer Leader
                through the University 101 Programs. In this role, I co-instruct a class focused on career
                exploration, financial literacy, and interview/application skills in a diverse classroom, ranging in
                year and major. I have also served as a U101 Peer Leader for two fall semesters. This class aims
                at helping first-semester freshmen transition to their college lives easily by equipping them with
                resources and peer and faculty support. These roles have allowed me to grow into my position as
                a role model and develop meaningful relationships with other undergraduate students. I have also
                been able to network with other Peer Leaders and gain insight as to how constructive feedback
                and discussion can be applied to classroom settings. Additionally, I also hold a Sales Associate
                position at Dickâ€™s Sporting Goods. I enjoy running in my free time, so naturally I gravitated
                towards selling running and other athletic shoes. This part-time job has taught me about the
                importance of time management and prioritization in my academic and work life.

                Arguably the most specialized part of my undergraduate experience to my intended
                career is my involvement in undergraduate research. I currently work for two different research
                labs on campus as an undergraduate research assistant. I began volunteering in the
                Neurolinguistics Lab transcribing vowel production data for the larger data repository collected
                by the Aging Brain Cohort. Out of this work, my thesis director and I developed my own project
                for which I received the Science Undergraduate Research Fellowship from the South Carolina
                Honors College. This project also serves as my Senior Thesis and will be presented at Discover
                USC in April 2025. Soon after starting in the Neurolinguistics Lab, I began working for the
                Affect and Cognition Lab collecting physiology data for studies focusing on misophonia, a
                prevalent but lesser-known disorder, and affect, or emotional response. I received the Mini-
                Magellan grant for my project investigating the relationship between misophonia severity and
                Axis-1 mental disorders, specifically those related to anxious and obsessive-compulsive
                tendencies. This project will also be presented at Discover USC. I personally struggle with
                misophonia in my everyday life, and I am so grateful for the opportunity to research something
                pertinent to me. Most recently, a group and I have been developing a project focused on bringing
                awareness and community about misophonia to USC. My involvement in research has not only
                shown me the beginning-to-end process of research but also allowed me to network with faculty
                and graduate students in my field of interest, connections that are incredibly valuable to my goal
                of attending graduate school myself.

                Knowing that my career goal is in the field of psychology research, I used my
                undergraduate research experiences to narrow down what exactly I am passionate about. When I
                took Cognitive Psychology as a sophomore, I wrote my final paper on psycholinguistics. My
                research projects and class topics have helped me determine my interest in studying language
                processing. As a graduate student, I hope to work in development language acquisition labs,
                especially those focused on cross-linguistic and naturalistic environments. I hope to continue to
                pursue language processing in the future as a researcher, academic, and professor.
